Shall return TRUE if		  writing can continue, or FALSE if the output stream can't be written		  to at all.				Close () as Boolean				  Shall be called after all Write... calls have been performed. Allows		  the called to close the stream. The called should make a final check		  that the former writes were successful and return FALSE if it turns		  out that there was an error. Should return TRUE if it is assumed that		  all data was written successfully.				Write (data as String) as Boolean				  Writes the string to the output stream. Returns FALSE if the write is		  known to be unsuccessful, otherwise TRUE.				  This means that the caller can't be 100% sure that the write was		  successful, but he should stop sendin more data as soon as this		  function returns FALSE.				Skip (count as Integer) as Boolean				  Similar to Write(), this will advance by the given amount of bytes		  in the output stream, writing zeros or just changing the position		  without overwriting any data. This means that in the case of a random		  access file being the output of the stream, the skipped part may		  still contain formerly written random data. The file must be extended		  include the added amount, though.		  		  The returned Boolean value follows the same rules as in Write()				Flush () as Boolean				  Writes any outstanding data and checks that all data has been written		  successfully - similar to Close, but without closing the stream.				GetErrorDescription (ByRef code as Integer, ByRef msg as String)				  If an error had occured since the call to Open, the called shall set		  'code' to a non-zero value, and the 'msg' string to a descriptive		  message that could be shown to a user (for debugging, mostly). It is		  recommended to set 'code' to -1 to flag a "unspecific error". If no		  error condition exists, 'code' shall be set to 0 and 'msg' to an empty		  string.				ClearError ()				  Sets the error state to "no error"	#tag EndNote	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Index"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InitialValue="2147483648"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Left"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Name"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Super"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Top"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Interface#tag EndInterface
