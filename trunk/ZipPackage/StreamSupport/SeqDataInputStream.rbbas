Shall return FALSE if		  an error condition has arised (but not if there is just no data to		  read because the stream is already empty). Shall return TRUE		  otherwise.				Close ()				  Shall be called after all Read... calls have been performed. Allows		  the called to close the stream.				Read (count as Integer) as String				  Reads "count" bytes from the input stream and returns them as a		  string. If less than the requested amount of data is available, that		  lesser amount shall be returned. If an error has occured or if no more		  data is available, an empty string shall be returned.				  The caller is responsible for making sure that he has received as much		  data as expected, for instance by checking the length of the returned		  data with the LenB() function. If the amount is less than what was		  requested, then the caller should check whether it was due to an error		  or because no more data is available with the two functions EOF() and		  Error().				Skip (count as Integer) as Boolean				  Similar to Read, but does not return the amount of data that's been		  read or skipped. Returns TRUE if the skip was successful, FALSE if		  not as many bytes could be skipped, which means that it might have		  reached the end of the stream or that an error has occured.				EOF () as Boolean				  Shall return TRUE if there is no more data available to read from the		  input stream.				HadError () as Boolean				  Shall return TRUE if an error condition has arisen since any of the		  past calls to Open and Read, unless ClearError was called since an		  error had occured.				GetErrorDescription (ByRef code as Integer, ByRef msg as String)				  If an error had occured since the call to Open, the called shall set		  'code' to a non-zero value, and the 'msg' string to a descriptive		  message that could be shown to a user (for debugging, mostly). It is		  recommended to set 'code' to -1 to flag a "unspecific error". If no		  error condition exists, 'code' shall be set to 0 and 'msg' to an empty		  string.				ClearError ()				  Sets the error state to "no error"	#tag EndNote	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Index"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InitialValue="2147483648"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Left"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Name"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Super"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Top"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Interface#tag EndInterface
