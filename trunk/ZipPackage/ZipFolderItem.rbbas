Instead, the file data inside the archive would then need to be		copied to a large enough unused area inside the archive, or be appended to its end,		create a gap inside the archive (when can be removed by calling ZipArchive.Compact).				For that reason, I rather not even offer rename and move functions because they		could cause unexpected inefficiencies using the archive. Instead, you should plan to		use a zip archive by figuring all names and folders before adding the files into the		archive, in order to avoid renames thereafter.				If, however, you really need a Rename or Move function, I can add that on request,		provided you're showing your support for this being shareware (hint hint).			#tag EndNote	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Index"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InitialValue="-2147483648"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Left"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Name"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Super"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Top"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Class#tag EndClass
