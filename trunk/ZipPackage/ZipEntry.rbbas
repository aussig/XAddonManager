To overcome this		  limitation, one would have to move any data behind the modified		  entry, which can be quite inefficient with larger archives. Instead,		  the way to go is to Remove the original entry, then generate a new		  one and copy the compressed data over. The only exception is when		  the replacement will be the same size or smaller than the original.		  In case it's smaller, ZipArchive.Compact should be called afterwards.	#tag EndNote	#tag ViewBehavior		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Index"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InitialValue="2147483648"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Left"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Name"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Super"			Visible=true			Group="ID"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty		#tag ViewProperty			Name="Top"			Visible=true			Group="Position"			InitialValue="0"			InheritedFrom="Object"		#tag EndViewProperty	#tag EndViewBehaviorEnd Class#tag EndClass
