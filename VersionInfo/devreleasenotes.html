		<h1>Release Notes</h1>
		
		<h2>Version 3.0.0 - xx xxx xxxx</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>New Feature: Search, download and install packages from X-Plane.org directly in the application.  This includes by name or location.</li>
			<li>New Feature: New high-resolution zoomed map</li>
			<li>Localisation: Catalan translation updated</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Version 2.0.0 - 3rd September 2010</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>New Feature: Can now create folders from the aircraft panel, when another folder is selected.</li>
			<li>New Feature: All addons now have appropriate icons.</li>
			<li>New Feature: Added several menu items to select which packages are plotted on the map.</li>
			<li>New Feature: Additional support has been added for Sandy Barbour's Python Plugin -  all the Python scripts that are installed for this plugin can now be viewed too.</li>
			<li>New Feature: Within each Custom Scenery Package, a list of the airports that the package provides are displayed.</li>
			<li>New Feature: The map now has a mini-zoom feature as you roll over it.</li>
			<li>New Feature: Added rollover tooltips to the map - when the cursor rolls over a scenery package the name of the package is shown.</li>
			<li>Optimisation: Re-implemented some of the map drawing code to reduce flicker on Windows as much as possible.</li>
			<li>Bug Fix: Fixed crash that would occur if the hard disk was renamed on the Mac.</li>
			<li>Bug Fix: When double clicking an item, it is displayed in the operating system if it's a folder otherwise we display its parent folder.</li>
			<li>Bug Fix: Now automatically requests admin user privileges on Windows versions that require it, allowing the app to work on those versions of Windows (e.g. Vista, Windows 7).</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Version 1.2.0 - 2nd September 2008</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>New Feature: Groups.  Groups of addons can now be created, allowing for quick enabling and disabling of sets of addons at once.  Several users have requested this, and it can be used for many purposes.  For example, seasonal winter packages could be grouped so they can all be enabled at once, or certain packages and plugins could be grouped so they can be enabled for flying online.</li>
			<li>Modification: The behaviour is now slightly different when installing addons - Previously, the application would allow you to install an addon with the same name as one that was currently <strong>disabled</strong>.  This meant that you could end up with disabled and enabled versions of the same addon, which could be confusing.  Now, the application will disallow this.</li>
			<li>Modification: Made the column layout more consistent across all addon types.</li>
			<li>Modification: Added rollover tooltip help to all controls.</li>
			<li>Under the covers: Re-wrote all the message and error reporting. It now uses proper 'sheet' panels on the Mac and the display is better on Windows and Linux too - the correct info / warning / error icons are now displayed.</li>
			<li>Under the covers: Re-wrote and extended the way preferences are stored.  Each X-Plane folder now has its own set of preferences, which means that as you switch folders XAM will remember which scenery packages you chose to plot on the map.  This work was also required to properly support the new Groups functionality mentioned above.</li>
		</ol>
